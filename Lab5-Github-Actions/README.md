# Lab5 Github Actions
In Lab 3 you created a sample website with the content hosted by cloud storage.  In this lab you create a simple CI/CD pipeline to automate pushing content. 

> [!TIP]
> While it is possible to manage data and directly interact with cloud storage, most CI/CD pipelines leverage repositories and other tools to control content.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Instructions are provided for AWS, Azure, and GCP.  Pick only one for your lab report.
